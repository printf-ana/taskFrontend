# taskFrontend

This is a frontend for a laravel project.

I want to create a project management with:

Workspaces containing projects and teams for permissions.

Projects are based on tasks, and each task can have its subtask(s).

I would like to use Bootstrap 4 for the site, and I would need pages mentioned in the Issues.
